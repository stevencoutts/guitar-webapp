## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevencoutts/guitar-webapp.git
   cd guitar-webapp
   ```

2. **Create Environment File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/guitar.db
   FLASK_ENV=production  # or development for dev mode
   ```
   - The `FLASK_ENV` variable controls whether the app runs in development (Flask dev server) or production (Gunicorn) mode.

3. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./update.sh
   ```
   - This script will update dependencies, rebuild the Docker image, and start the app using Docker Compose.
   - The environment is determined by the `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml`.

4. **Access the App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

5. **Login**: Use the default admin account:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `Password1`

### Manual Installation

2. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevencoutts/guitar-webapp.git
   cd guitar-webapp
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create `.env` file:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/guitar.db
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ```

## üé∏ Practice Mode & Play-Along (NEW)

### What is Practice Mode?
Practice Mode is a hands-free, interactive way to play through a song's chord progression in time with the strumming pattern and metronome. It highlights each chord in sequence, auto-scrolls the progression, and can start the metronome automatically. Great for real practice sessions when you can't touch the screen!

### How to Use Practice Mode
1. **Open a Song**: Go to any song's detail page.
2. **Click 'Practice Mode'**: Button is in the Chord Progression card.
3. **Countdown**: A 3-2-1-Go! countdown (with audio beeps) gives you time to get ready.
4. **Play-Along**: Chords are highlighted in order, each for the correct musical duration:
   - **Full-measure chords**: Highlighted for the full strumming pattern length (e.g., 4 beats for a 4/4 pattern).
   - **Half-measure chords**: (e.g., two chords inside | |) Each is highlighted for half the strumming pattern duration.
   - **Custom durations**: Chords written as `C (4 beats)` are held for the specified number of beats.
5. **Metronome Sync**: Optionally, the metronome starts automatically and stops with practice mode.
6. **Stop Anytime**: Use the floating 'Stop' button or modal to exit practice mode.

### Practice Mode Features
- **Auto-advance**: No need to scroll or tap‚Äîchords move in time with the music.
- **Visual Highlighting**: The current chord is always highlighted and scrolled into view.
- **Metronome Integration**: Practice in perfect time.
- **Countdown with Beeps**: Get ready before you start.
- **Supports all time signatures and strumming patterns**: Including triplets, multi-bar patterns, and custom subdivisions.

## üìù How to Enter Chord Progressions (Editing/Adding Songs)

### Basic Syntax
- **Chords**: Enter chord names separated by spaces. Example: `C G Am F`
- **Barlines**: Use a new line for each bar (recommended for clarity), or group bars visually.
- **Half-measure chords**: Use vertical bars to enclose two chords that share a bar: `| C G |` (C for half, G for half)
- **Section headers**: Start a line with `#` for section labels (e.g., `# Verse 1`, `# Chorus`)
- **Custom beat durations**: Add `(N beats)` after a chord for custom duration: `C (4 beats) G (2 beats)`

### Examples
```
# Verse 1
C G Am F
| C G | C Am Fmaj7

# Chorus
F G C (4 beats)
```
- The first line is a section header.
- The second line is four chords, one per bar.
- The third line is a bar with two half-measure chords, then three full-measure chords.
- The chorus has a chord with a custom duration.

### Tips
- **Half-measure**: Only use `| |` for two chords per bar. For more complex splits, use custom durations.
- **Section headers**: These are displayed visually in the chart view.
- **Formatting**: Extra spaces and blank lines are ignored.
- **Supported chords**: Any chord name recognized by the app (e.g., C, G, Am, Fmaj7, D7, etc.)

## üÜï Strumming Pattern & Practice Mode Integration
- The strumming pattern's length (in beats) determines how long each chord is held in practice mode.
- If a strumming pattern covers multiple bars, each chord (or half-measure chord) is held for the full pattern duration (or half, if inside | |).
- Custom durations override the default.
- Practice mode always matches the musical feel of your strumming pattern and progression.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database is empty after rebuild**:
- Ensure `.env` file exists with correct `DATABASE_URL`
- Check volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`
- Verify `./instance/guitar.db` exists on host

**Audio not working**:
- Check browser console for Web Audio API errors
- Ensure user interaction before audio (browser requirement)
- Try refreshing the page

**Chord diagrams not displaying**:
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
- Verify chord exists in database
- Try accessing chord directly: `/chord/C`

**Performance issues**:
- Check Docker resource allocation
- Monitor container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Consider PostgreSQL for larger datasets
